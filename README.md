ATM, my main focus is around making 3d models for 3d priting in JS, by coding models I want to print
and also contributing to [OpenJSCAD](https://github.com/jscad/OpenJSCAD.org) or indirectly by prototyping new things
like [jscadui](https://github.com/hrgdavor/jscadui/). If interested in CODE-CAD using JS you can also join the crowd in the [jscad discord channel](https://discord.gg/AaqGskur93).

Check out the [demo here](https://hrgdavor.github.io/jscadui/html-gizmo/). It is also a nice example of using shadow DOM.    |
