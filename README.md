ATM, my main focus is around making 3d models for 3d priting in JS, by coding models I want to print.

Trying to contribute as much as I can directly to [OpenJSCAD](https://github.com/jscad/OpenJSCAD.org) or indirectly by prototyping new things
like [jscadui](https://github.com/hrgdavor/jscadui/). 

If you are interested in CODE-CAD using JS you can also join the crowd in the [jscad discord channel](https://discord.gg/6PB7qZ4HC7).

Cube camera gizmo for 3d views, a parametrizable Web Component. Check out the [demo here](https://hrgdavor.github.io/jscadui/html-gizmo/). It is also a nice example of using shadow DOM.
